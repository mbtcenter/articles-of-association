    \end{enumerate}
    } % end textnormal
    \item Dispute Resolution
    \textnormal{

Such positions are commonly referred to as the office bearers of the association. In addition to office bearers, many associations also have ordinary members on the committee who do not hold a formal title. You may wish to have separate provisions to address the election or appointment of office bearers and ordinary members (if any) to the committee.
    \end{enumerate}
    } % end textnormal
    \item Management Terms
    \textnormal{
    \begin{enumerate}

      \item (c) Reasons why the office of a member of the committee becomes vacant. Generally these include the end of term, resignation, death, insolvency (bankruptcy) or loss of mental capacity or being removed from office by a resolution of the association at a general meeting.
      \linebreak[1]

    } % end textnormal
    \item Interim Management
    \textnormal{
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item (d) The filling of casual vacancies occurring within the committee. This is where a member of the committee ceases to hold office before their term of appointment ends (such as if they resign or die). Your rules could include a process for the committee or president to appoint someone to fill the office until the term for that position ends.
    \end{enumerate}
    } % end textnormal
    \item Meetings
    \textnormal{
    \begin{enumerate}

    \end{enumerate}
    } % end textnormal
    \item Secretary Cessation
    \textnormal{
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The procedures for the appointment and removal of the secretary. If the secretary is a member of the committee of your association under your rules, then the procedure for appointment and removal of committee members will be sufficient to cover this.

    } % end textnormal
    \item Records
    \textnormal{
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The custody of records, securities and other relevant documents of the incorporated association. Set out who is responsible for this.

They are also entitled to a copy of the rules of their association or minutes of general meetings if they make a request in writing to their association for a copy.
      \linebreak[1]
      \item If a member requests to inspect the register of members, the incorporated association must allow this at a reasonable time.
      \linebreak[1]
      \item Your rules may also provide for a member to be able to obtain a copy of the register of members but this is optional – you could provide for inspection but not allow copying.

    } % end textnormal
    \item Minutes of Meetings

    } % end textnormal
    \item General Meetings
    \textnormal{
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item State how many general meetings the association must have each year and the period between those meetings. For example, the association may hold a general meeting every four months. The Act only requires an association to hold one general meeting per year, being the annual general meeting. Holding additional general meetings is decided by each association.
      \linebreak[1]
      \item Your rules must also provide for the manner in which a general meeting may be called. For example, general meetings may be called by the secretary or the committee or by a specified number or percentage of members giving a request in writing to the secretary to call a general meeting.

The rules must also set out the period of notice (if any) a member must give other members if they propose to move a motion at a general meeting. If you wish to allow for members to propose motions from the floor at a general meeting, state that no advance notice is required.
      \linebreak[1]
      \item The Act imposes specific requirements for notice where the motion requires a special resolution for it to be passed.
      \linebreak[1]
      \item A motion proposing an alteration to the rules of an incorporated association must be passed by a special resolution.
      \linebreak[1]

      \item - is responsible for paying funds received into the associations’ bank account
      \item - can authorise expenditure by the association and how authorisation is given (such as by signature of the treasurer and another committee member)

      \item Provide for the process to be followed to alter your rules, including adding new rules and removing old rules. This must be consistent with the requirements of the Act and a simple statement that the rules of the association may be altered by special resolution at a general meeting of the association is sufficient.

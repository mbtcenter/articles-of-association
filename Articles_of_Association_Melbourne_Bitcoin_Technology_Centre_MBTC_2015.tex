    \end{enumerate}
    } % end textnormal
    \item Dispute Resolution
    \textnormal{
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The grievance procedures for settling disputes under the rules between the incorporated association and any members or between a member and other member.

    \linebreak[1]
      \item The rules must identify the name by which the governing body is known (this may simply be ?the committee?) and the membership of the committee, such as president, vice president, treasurer or secretary. Such positions are commonly referred to as the office bearers of the association. In addition to office bearers, many associations also have ordinary members on the committee who do not hold a formal title. You may wish to have separate provisions to address the election or appointment of office bearers and ordinary members (if any) to the committee.
    \end{enumerate}
    } % end textnormal
    \item Management Terms
    \textnormal{
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item (b) The terms of office of members of the committee. For example, members may hold office for a term of one year and then be eligible for re-election or reappointment at the next annual general meeting.
      \item (c) Reasons why the office of a member of the committee becomes vacant. Generally these include the end of term, resignation, death, insolvency (bankruptcy) or loss of mental capacity or being removed from office by a resolution of the association at a general meeting.
      \linebreak[1]
      \item A member of the committee of an association vacates office in the circumstances provided in the rules of the association and if the member:
      \linebreak[1]
      \item - resigns by written notice addressed to the committee

    \end{enumerate}
    } % end textnormal
    \item Interim Management
    \textnormal{
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item (d) The filling of casual vacancies occurring within the committee. This is where a member of the committee ceases to hold office before their term of appointment ends (such as if they resign or die). Your rules could include a process for the committee or president to appoint someone to fill the office until the term for that position ends.
    \end{enumerate}
    } % end textnormal
    \item Meetings
    \textnormal{
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item (e) The quorum and procedure at meetings of the committee. The quorum is the minimum number of committee members who must be present before a committee meeting can be held. You can express this as a whole number or as a percentage or fraction.
      \linebreak[1]
      \item Your rules must also cover the procedure to be followed at committee meetings, such as:
      \linebreak[1]
      \item - how much notice committee members will be given before meetings
      \item - who chairs committee meetings
      \item - order of business

    \end{enumerate}
    } % end textnormal
    \item Secretary Cessation
    \textnormal{
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The procedures for the appointment and removal of the secretary. If the secretary is a member of the committee of your association under your rules, then the procedure for appointment and removal of committee members will be sufficient to cover this.
    \end{enumerate}
    } % end textnormal
    \item Records
    \textnormal{
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The custody of records, securities and other relevant documents of the incorporated association. Set out who is responsible for this.
    \end{enumerate}
    } % end textnormal
    \item Common Seal
    \textnormal{
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Provisions for the custody and use of the association’s common seal (if any). Use of a common seal is optional. If your association has one, the rules must state who is responsible for custody of the seal.
      \item Provisions for members to have access to, and to be able to obtain copies of, the records, securities and other relevant documents. These rules should cover:
      \linebreak[1]

      \item - the association’s transactions, dealings, business or property
      \item - which records the committee may refuse to permit inspection of, such as confidential personal, employment, commercial or legal matters

They are also entitled to a copy of the rules of their association or minutes of general meetings if they make a request in writing to their association for a copy.
      \linebreak[1]
      \item If a member requests to inspect the register of members, the incorporated association must allow this at a reasonable time.
      \linebreak[1]
      \item Your rules may also provide for a member to be able to obtain a copy of the register of members but this is optional – you could provide for inspection but not allow copying.
    \end{enumerate}
    } % end textnormal
    \item Minutes of Meetings
    \textnormal{
    \begin{enumerate}

    \textnormal{
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Right of access (if any) members have to minutes of meetings of the committee, including any terms and conditions subject to which access may be granted. You do not have to allow members access to minutes of committee meetings, but you must state whether or not you will allow it.

    } % end textnormal
    \item General Meetings
    \textnormal{
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item State how many general meetings the association must have each year and the period between those meetings. For example, the association may hold a general meeting every four months. The Act only requires an association to hold one general meeting per year, being the annual general meeting. Holding additional general meetings is decided by each association.
      \linebreak[1]
      \item Your rules must also provide for the manner in which a general meeting may be called. For example, general meetings may be called by the secretary or the committee or by a specified number or percentage of members giving a request in writing to the secretary to call a general meeting.

    } % end textnormal

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Set out the period of notice required to be given to members of a forthcoming general meeting and the manner in which notice is to be given (such as post or email or both). The rules must also set out the period of notice (if any) a member must give other members if they propose to move a motion at a general meeting. If you wish to allow for members to propose motions from the floor at a general meeting, state that no advance notice is required.
      \linebreak[1]
      \item The Act imposes specific requirements for notice where the motion requires a special resolution for it to be passed.
      \linebreak[1]
      \item A motion proposing an alteration to the rules of an incorporated association must be passed by a special resolution.
      \linebreak[1]
      \item A special resolution must be passed by at least 75\% of the members present or voting by proxy at a general meeting
      \linebreak[1]

    \textnormal{
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The manner in which the funds of the incorporated association must be managed and, in particular, the mode of drawing and signing cheques on behalf of the incorporated association. Include who:

      \item - is responsible for receiving funds on behalf of the association and issuing receipts for those funds
      \item - is responsible for paying funds received into the associations’ bank account
      \item - can authorise expenditure by the association and how authorisation is given (such as by signature of the treasurer and another committee member)
      \item - can sign cheques on behalf of the association and what authorisation they need to do so (such as resolution of the committee).
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Altering These Articles
    \textnormal{
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Provide for the process to be followed to alter your rules, including adding new rules and removing old rules. This must be consistent with the requirements of the Act and a simple statement that the rules of the association may be altered by special resolution at a general meeting of the association is sufficient.
    \end{enumerate}
    } % end textnormal

      \item Set out what is to happen to any surplus assets of the association if it is wound up or dissolved. The distribution of surplus assets must not be contrary to the Act and generally surplus assets must not be distributed to any member or former member of the association.
